- **‚úÖ Configuration management** with backup and rollback safety

### 3. Operations & Maintenance (The Guardian) üõ°Ô∏è
- Real-time monitoring and metrics collection
- Automated root cause analysis and incident response
- Integration with ticketing systems
- Performance baseline establishment

### 4. Security & Compliance (The Sentinel) üîí
- Firewall rule and ACL management
- Security audit automation and compliance reporting
- Traffic analysis and threat detection
- Vulnerability assessment and remediation

### 5. MaaS & Insights (The Analyst) üìä
- **Key Differentiator**: ML-based predictive analytics
- Performance trending and capacity forecasting
- Network optimization recommendations
- Executive dashboards and reporting

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher
- SSH access to network devices
- Administrative credentials for target devices

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd NetArchon/AINetwork
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Verify installation**
   ```bash
   python3 -m pytest tests/ -v
   ```

### Basic Usage

```python
from src.netarchon.core.ssh_connector import SSHConnector
from src.netarchon.core.device_manager import DeviceDetector
from src.netarchon.core.config_manager import ConfigManager
from src.netarchon.models.connection import ConnectionInfo, ConnectionType, ConnectionStatus

# Create connection
connection = ConnectionInfo(
    device_id="router1",
    host="192.168.1.1",
    port=22,
    username="admin",
    connection_type=ConnectionType.SSH,
    status=ConnectionStatus.CONNECTED
)

# Connect to device
ssh = SSHConnector()
ssh.connect("192.168.1.1", "admin", "password")

# Detect device type
detector = DeviceDetector()
device_type = detector.detect_device_type(connection)

# Backup configuration
config_manager = ConfigManager()
backup_path = config_manager.backup_config(connection, "Initial backup")
```

## üìä Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Features (Tasks 1-10)
- **Core Infrastructure**: SSH connectivity, command execution, device management
- **Device Support**: Cisco IOS/NX-OS, Juniper JUNOS, Arista EOS, Generic devices
