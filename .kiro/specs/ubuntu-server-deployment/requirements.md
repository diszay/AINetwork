4. WHEN the system boots THEN it SHALL automatically start all NetArchon services
5. WHEN system resources are monitored THEN CPU usage SHALL remain below 20% during normal operation
6. WHEN memory usage is monitored THEN RAM usage SHALL remain below 2GB during normal operation

### Requirement 2: Network Configuration and Security

**User Story:** As a home user, I want my NetArchon server to be securely accessible from my home network so that I can monitor my network from any device while maintaining security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network interfaces are configured THEN the server SHALL have a static IP address on the home network
2. WHEN firewall is configured THEN only necessary ports SHALL be open (SSH, NetArchon web interface)
3. WHEN SSH access is configured THEN it SHALL use key-based authentication with password authentication disabled
4. WHEN the web interface is accessed THEN it SHALL be available on port 8501 from the local network only
5. WHEN security updates are applied THEN the system SHALL automatically install critical security patches
6. WHEN intrusion detection is active THEN fail2ban SHALL be configured to protect SSH access

### Requirement 3: Python Environment and Dependencies

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a properly configured Python environment so that NetArchon runs reliably with all required dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Python is installed THEN it SHALL be Python 3.12 (Ubuntu 24.04.2 default) or compatible version
2. WHEN virtual environment is created THEN it SHALL isolate NetArchon dependencies from system packages
3. WHEN pip packages are installed THEN they SHALL be pinned to specific versions for reproducibility
4. WHEN system libraries are installed THEN all NetArchon dependencies SHALL be satisfied
5. WHEN the environment is activated THEN all NetArchon modules SHALL import successfully
6. WHEN package updates are needed THEN they SHALL be managed through the virtual environment

### Requirement 4: Database and Storage Configuration

**User Story:** As a network monitoring user, I want reliable data storage so that my network monitoring history is preserved and accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SQLite database is configured THEN it SHALL be stored in a dedicated data directory with proper permissions
2. WHEN database backups are configured THEN they SHALL run automatically daily with 30-day retention
3. WHEN log files are managed THEN they SHALL rotate automatically to prevent disk space issues
4. WHEN data directories are created THEN they SHALL have appropriate ownership and permissions (netarchon:netarchon, 750)
5. WHEN disk space is monitored THEN alerts SHALL trigger when usage exceeds 80%
6. WHEN database integrity is checked THEN it SHALL be verified automatically on startup

### Requirement 5: Service Management and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want NetArchon to run as a reliable system service so that it starts automatically and recovers from failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN systemd service is configured THEN NetArchon SHALL start automatically on system boot
2. WHEN the service fails THEN it SHALL restart automatically with exponential backoff
3. WHEN service logs are generated THEN they SHALL be accessible through journalctl
4. WHEN service status is checked THEN it SHALL report healthy status and uptime
5. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN the service SHALL have appropriate resource limits
6. WHEN the service is stopped THEN it SHALL shut down gracefully without data loss

### Requirement 6: Web Interface Accessibility

**User Story:** As a home network user, I want to access the NetArchon dashboard from any device on my network so that I can monitor my network from computers, tablets, and phones.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the web interface is accessed THEN it SHALL be responsive on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
2. WHEN accessing from the local network THEN the dashboard SHALL load within 3 seconds
3. WHEN multiple users access simultaneously THEN the interface SHALL remain responsive
4. WHEN the interface is used THEN it SHALL work with all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
5. WHEN network devices are managed THEN changes SHALL be reflected in real-time
6. WHEN alerts are generated THEN they SHALL appear immediately in the web interface

### Requirement 7: Integration and Extensibility

**User Story:** As a power user, I want NetArchon to integrate with my existing tools so that I can extend its functionality and integrate with my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN BitWarden integration is configured THEN it SHALL automatically retrieve network device credentials
2. WHEN RustDesk integration is enabled THEN it SHALL monitor remote desktop sessions
3. WHEN API endpoints are accessed THEN they SHALL provide programmatic access to all functionality
4. WHEN webhook notifications are configured THEN they SHALL deliver alerts to external systems
5. WHEN custom scripts are added THEN they SHALL be able to interact with NetArchon data
6. WHEN third-party tools connect THEN they SHALL have access through documented APIs

### Requirement 8: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a home network administrator, I want NetArchon to efficiently monitor my network without impacting system performance so that it can run continuously on modest hardware.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring 50+ devices THEN system performance SHALL remain optimal
2. WHEN collecting metrics THEN network impact SHALL be minimal (< 1% of available bandwidth)
3. WHEN storing historical data THEN database size SHALL be managed through retention policies
4. WHEN generating reports THEN they SHALL complete within 10 seconds for standard time ranges
5. WHEN concurrent users access the interface THEN response times SHALL remain under 2 seconds
6. WHEN system resources are limited THEN NetArchon SHALL gracefully reduce monitoring frequency

### Requirement 9: Backup and Recovery

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive backup and recovery procedures so that I can restore NetArchon quickly if hardware fails.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backups are created THEN they SHALL include configuration, database, and custom settings
2. WHEN backup restoration is needed THEN the process SHALL be documented and tested
3. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN they SHALL be automatically backed up
4. WHEN disaster recovery is required THEN NetArchon SHALL be restorable on new hardware within 30 minutes

6. WHEN backup storage is managed THEN old backups SHALL be automatically pruned

### Requirement 10: Documentation and Support

**User Story:** As a user deploying NetArchon on Ubuntu Server, I want comprehensive documentation so that I can successfully install, configure, and maintain the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installation is performed THEN step-by-step Ubuntu 24.04.2 specific instructions SHALL be available
2. WHEN troubleshooting is needed THEN common Ubuntu server issues SHALL be documented with solutions
3. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN the impact SHALL be documented with examples
4. WHEN maintenance is required THEN procedures SHALL be clearly documented
5. WHEN updates are applied THEN the process SHALL be documented with rollback procedures
