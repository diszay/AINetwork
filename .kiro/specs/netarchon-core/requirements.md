# Requirements Document

## Introduction

NetArchon is an autonomous AI agent that embodies the complete skill set of a senior network engineer. The system must be capable of designing, implementing, managing, and securing computer networks while functioning as a Monitoring-as-a-Service (MaaS) platform that transforms raw network data into actionable, high-level insights. The development follows a strict principle of simplicity at every step, with functionality organized around five core pillars: Design & Planning, Implementation & Deployment, Operations & Maintenance, Security & Compliance, and MaaS & Insights.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core SSH Connectivity Module

**User Story:** As a network engineer, I want NetArchon to establish secure SSH connections to network devices, so that it can perform automated configuration and monitoring tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN NetArchon attempts to connect to a network device THEN the system SHALL establish an SSH connection using provided credentials
2. WHEN an SSH connection fails THEN the system SHALL log the error with specific details and retry according to configured parameters
3. WHEN an SSH connection is established THEN the system SHALL validate the connection by executing a basic command
4. IF connection credentials are invalid THEN the system SHALL raise an authentication error with clear messaging
5. WHEN multiple devices need connections THEN the system SHALL manage concurrent SSH sessions efficiently

### Requirement 2: Basic Command Execution Framework

**User Story:** As a network engineer, I want NetArchon to execute commands on network devices, so that it can gather information and make configuration changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a command is sent to a device THEN the system SHALL execute it and return the output
2. WHEN command execution times out THEN the system SHALL handle the timeout gracefully and log the incident
3. WHEN a command returns an error THEN the system SHALL capture and parse the error for further analysis
4. IF a command requires elevated privileges THEN the system SHALL handle privilege escalation automatically
5. WHEN executing multiple commands THEN the system SHALL maintain session state appropriately

### Requirement 3: Device Detection and Classification

**User Story:** As a network engineer, I want NetArchon to automatically detect device types and capabilities, so that it can adapt its behavior to different network equipment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting to a new device THEN the system SHALL identify the device type (Cisco, Juniper, etc.)
2. WHEN device type is identified THEN the system SHALL load appropriate command syntax and behaviors
3. WHEN device capabilities are unknown THEN the system SHALL attempt standard discovery methods
4. IF device type cannot be determined THEN the system SHALL use generic command patterns with fallback options
5. WHEN device information is gathered THEN the system SHALL cache it for future connections

### Requirement 4: Configuration Management Foundation

**User Story:** As a network engineer, I want NetArchon to safely manage device configurations, so that network changes can be automated while maintaining system stability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making configuration changes THEN the system SHALL create a backup of the current configuration first
2. WHEN applying new configurations THEN the system SHALL validate syntax before deployment
3. WHEN configuration deployment fails THEN the system SHALL automatically rollback to the previous state
4. IF configuration changes affect connectivity THEN the system SHALL implement safety mechanisms to prevent lockout
5. WHEN configurations are modified THEN the system SHALL log all changes with timestamps and reasons

### Requirement 5: Basic Monitoring and Data Collection

**User Story:** As a network engineer, I want NetArchon to collect basic network metrics and status information, so that I can monitor network health and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring is enabled THEN the system SHALL collect interface statistics at regular intervals
2. WHEN collecting metrics THEN the system SHALL store data in a structured format for analysis
3. WHEN device status changes THEN the system SHALL detect and log the change
4. IF monitoring data collection fails THEN the system SHALL retry and escalate if necessary
5. WHEN historical data is requested THEN the system SHALL provide metrics within specified time ranges

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Logging

**User Story:** As a network engineer, I want NetArchon to provide comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues and understand system behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any operation fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including context
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL categorize them by severity and type
3. WHEN critical errors happen THEN the system SHALL alert administrators immediately
4. IF log files grow large THEN the system SHALL implement log rotation automatically
5. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL provide verbose logging options

### Requirement 7: Project Structure and Development Workflow

**User Story:** As a developer, I want NetArchon to follow a clear project structure and development workflow, so that the codebase remains maintainable and development is efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is initialized THEN the system SHALL create standard directories (src, docs, tasks)
2. WHEN development tasks are planned THEN they SHALL be documented in tasks/todo.md with checkboxes
3. WHEN code changes are made THEN each change SHALL be committed atomically with clear messages
4. IF development workflow is followed THEN all activities SHALL be logged in docs/activity.md
5. WHEN development milestones are reached THEN code SHALL be pushed to the main branch with review summaries
