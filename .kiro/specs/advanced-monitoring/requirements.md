# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Advanced Monitoring feature enhances NetArchon's monitoring capabilities to provide comprehensive, real-time visibility into network devices and services. This feature will enable omniscient awareness of network state, performance metrics, and potential issues through advanced data collection, analysis, and visualization. The system will support concurrent monitoring of multiple devices, intelligent alerting with pattern recognition, and persistent storage of metrics for historical analysis.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Advanced Metrics Collection

**User Story:** As a network administrator, I want to collect comprehensive metrics from multiple devices concurrently, so that I can have complete visibility into my network's performance and health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is configured for monitoring THEN it SHALL support concurrent collection of metrics from multiple devices
2. WHEN collecting metrics THEN the system SHALL use connection pooling and threading to optimize performance
3. WHEN a device is unreachable THEN the system SHALL implement circuit breaker patterns to prevent resource exhaustion
4. WHEN collecting metrics THEN the system SHALL support customizable collection intervals per device or device group
5. WHEN a metric collection fails THEN the system SHALL implement automatic retry with configurable backoff strategies
6. WHEN collecting metrics THEN the system SHALL support device-specific commands and parsing logic for different vendor platforms
7. WHEN collecting metrics THEN the system SHALL gather detailed interface statistics including errors, discards, and utilization

### Requirement 2: Persistent Metrics Storage

**User Story:** As a network administrator, I want metrics to be stored persistently, so that I can analyze historical trends and performance patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN metrics are collected THEN the system SHALL store them in a configurable backend (file, database, etc.)
2. WHEN storing metrics THEN the system SHALL implement efficient data structures to minimize storage requirements
3. WHEN storing metrics THEN the system SHALL include complete metadata and context information
4. WHEN retrieving metrics THEN the system SHALL support filtering by device, metric type, and time range
5. WHEN storing metrics THEN the system SHALL implement data retention policies to manage storage growth
6. WHEN metrics storage reaches configurable thresholds THEN the system SHALL automatically archive or prune old data
7. WHEN storing metrics THEN the system SHALL ensure data integrity through validation and error checking

### Requirement 3: Intelligent Alerting

**User Story:** As a network administrator, I want intelligent alerting based on complex conditions and patterns, so that I can focus on significant issues and reduce alert fatigue.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN metrics exceed defined thresholds THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate alerts
2. WHEN generating alerts THEN the system SHALL support complex alert conditions using multiple metrics and logical operators
3. WHEN similar alerts occur frequently THEN the system SHALL implement alert correlation to reduce duplicates
4. WHEN alerts are generated THEN the system SHALL support multiple notification channels (email, SMS, webhook, etc.)
5. WHEN an alert condition persists THEN the system SHALL implement cooldown periods to prevent alert storms
6. WHEN metrics show anomalous patterns THEN the system SHALL detect and alert on these anomalies
7. WHEN alerts are generated THEN the system SHALL support customizable severity levels and escalation paths

### Requirement 4: Metric Analysis and Visualization

**User Story:** As a network administrator, I want to analyze and visualize collected metrics, so that I can identify trends, patterns, and potential issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing metrics THEN the system SHALL provide statistical analysis (min, max, average, percentiles)
2. WHEN analyzing metrics THEN the system SHALL support trend analysis over configurable time periods
3. WHEN comparing metrics THEN the system SHALL detect significant changes and anomalies
4. WHEN visualizing metrics THEN the system SHALL support multiple visualization types (graphs, charts, tables)
5. WHEN analyzing metrics THEN the system SHALL support aggregation by device, device group, or metric type
6. WHEN viewing metrics THEN the system SHALL provide customizable dashboards for different use cases
7. WHEN analyzing metrics THEN the system SHALL support exporting data in standard formats (CSV, JSON)

### Requirement 5: Monitoring Resilience and Recovery

**User Story:** As a network administrator, I want the monitoring system to be resilient and recover automatically from failures, so that I can rely on continuous monitoring without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt to reconnect using exponential backoff
2. WHEN a device becomes unreachable THEN the system SHALL continue monitoring other devices without disruption
3. WHEN the monitoring system restarts THEN it SHALL automatically resume monitoring with previous configuration
4. WHEN a device returns to service THEN the system SHALL detect this and resume monitoring automatically
5. WHEN monitoring resources (CPU, memory) reach critical levels THEN the system SHALL adapt collection frequency
6. WHEN persistent storage is unavailable THEN the system SHALL buffer metrics in memory until storage is available
7. WHEN the system detects its own performance degradation THEN it SHALL log diagnostic information for troubleshooting

### Requirement 6: Extensible Monitoring Framework

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an extensible monitoring framework, so that I can easily add support for new device types, metrics, and storage backends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing new device support THEN the system SHALL provide clear extension points and interfaces
2. WHEN adding new metric types THEN the system SHALL support custom collection and parsing logic
3. WHEN implementing new storage backends THEN the system SHALL provide a consistent storage interface
4. WHEN extending the system THEN developers SHALL be able to add custom alert conditions and notification channels
5. WHEN adding new features THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive documentation and examples
6. WHEN implementing custom visualizations THEN the system SHALL provide access to raw and processed metric data
7. WHEN extending the system THEN developers SHALL be able to integrate with external monitoring systems

### Requirement 7: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a network administrator, I want the monitoring system to scale efficiently, so that I can monitor large networks without performance degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring 100+ devices THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive performance
2. WHEN collecting metrics THEN the system SHALL optimize resource usage (CPU, memory, network)
3. WHEN storing metrics THEN the system SHALL implement efficient data structures and compression
4. WHEN the number of monitored devices increases THEN the system SHALL scale horizontally if needed
5. WHEN processing metrics THEN the system SHALL use efficient algorithms for analysis and alerting
6. WHEN monitoring at scale THEN the system SHALL provide performance metrics about itself
7. WHEN deployed in distributed mode THEN the system SHALL coordinate monitoring tasks efficiently
