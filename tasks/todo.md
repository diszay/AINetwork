## Model Recommendation for Local Deployment

Based on your Mini PC Ubuntu 24.04 LTS environment and the omniscient capabilities required:

### Recommended Local AI Model Stack:
1. **Primary Model**: Ollama with Llama 3.1 8B or Mistral 7B
   - Optimized for local deployment on Ubuntu
   - Excellent for network automation and analysis tasks
   - Low resource requirements suitable for Mini PC

2. **Specialized Models**:
   - **Code Generation**: CodeLlama 7B for configuration generation
   - **Analysis**: Llama 3.1 8B for log analysis and pattern recognition
   - **Monitoring**: Mistral 7B for alert correlation and root cause analysis

3. **Integration Framework**:
   - Use LangChain for model orchestration
   - Implement RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with your network documentation
   - Create specialized prompts for network engineering tasks

### Hardware Requirements for Your Mini PC:
- **Minimum**: 16GB RAM, 4-core CPU
- **Recommended**: 32GB RAM, 8-core CPU
- **Storage**: 500GB+ SSD for model storage and metrics data
