    operator=RuleOperator.GREATER_THAN,
    threshold_value=80.0,
    severity=AlertSeverity.WARNING,
    evaluation_window_minutes=5,
    consecutive_breaches_required=3,
    notification_channels=[NotificationChannel.EMAIL, NotificationChannel.STREAMLIT]
)

alert_manager.add_rule(custom_rule)
```

**Alert Management**:
```python
# Get active alerts
active_alerts = alert_manager.get_active_alerts(severity_filter=AlertSeverity.CRITICAL)

# Acknowledge alert
alert_manager.acknowledge_alert(alert_id="alert_123", acknowledged_by="admin")

# Get alert statistics
